It is soft, light and has <SBR/>a shimmering quality. Silk imports led to <SBR/>such a drain of gold in Rome that it <SBR/>harmed the economy. The Roman <SBR/>writer Pliny complained that women&apos;s <SBR/>desire for the material was ruining the <SBR/>Roman Empire. During the Tang <SBR/>dynasty, thirty percent of the trade on <SBR/>the Silk Road was comprised of silk.</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Selling silk in modern Kashgar</FONT></P>Imports >>><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="10" COLOR="#FF6600">Horses</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000">Horses were particularly prized in China. They were very <SBR/>useful in warfare - they were vital in fighting off the nomads <SBR/>who roamed around China&apos;s northern border. They were also a <SBR/>sign of great wealth. &nbsp;Native horses tended to be small and <SBR/>stocky animals. &nbsp;The Chinese used the Silk Road to import the <SBR/>fine thoroughbreds of the steppes of central Asia. &nbsp;Polo was <SBR/>another import from Central Asia that gained popularity in <SBR/>China.</FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Tang dynasty glazed ceramic horse,</FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#FFFFFF">dated A.D. 728</FONT></P>A Camel<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000">Camels were the only beasts of burden that were able to survive in the <SBR/>harsh deserts that the Silk Road passed through. &nbsp;They could smell <SBR/>underground water. If a sandstorm was approaching they would huddle <SBR/>together and bury their mouths in the sand. &nbsp;This alerted their riders to the <SBR/>imminent danger. &nbsp;</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#FF6600"><B>Camel&apos;s feet</B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000">Camels have very large feet. This means that their weight is distributed <SBR/>over a large area. This makes it much easier for them to walk in the desert. &nbsp;<SBR/>Their feet would not sink down in the sand as much as other animals.</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#FF6600"><B>Provisions</B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000">Most merchants would not have travelled the whole of the Silk Road. &nbsp;<SBR/>Goods would be carried by a number of traders and merchants on the <SBR/>journey from East to West. Traders embarking on the Silk Road had to <SBR/>make sure they had enough provisions with them. The Silk Road went <SBR/>around the Taklamakan Desert. &nbsp;Travellers would stock up on provisions in <SBR/>oasis towns along the way. </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
