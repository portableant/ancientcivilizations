&main=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12">The Chinese believed in Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism. These were known as the 'Three Ways'. The three beliefs <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/complement.html','glos')">complement</a></font></u> each other with similar viewpoints on key areas. No one belief was any more important than another amongst the people. People chose to follow different parts of the three beliefs at the same time. The 'Three Ways' are still popular today.
&laozi1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12"><b>Daoism</b><br>This tile shows Laozi, who was associated with Daoism. Laozi is thought to have lived in the 6th century B.C.<br><br>His beliefs on life were recorded in a book called <i>Daode Jing</i>. He explained that in order to exist without trouble, life must balance with nature and the rest of the world. This is the idea of <i>yin-yang</i> where positive and negative forces work together to balance nature. Later these ideas developed into a religion with many gods being worshipped. The most well known were The Eight Immortals. Followers of Daoism tried to be at one with their spirit. To achieve this they chose their diet carefully and used breathing exercises to improve their concentration. They tried not to harm anything too.
&laozi2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12">Worship often took place on mountains because the high peaks were believed to reach the spirit world and they were removed from the hurried life of towns. Followers would be rewarded with <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/immortality.html','glos')">immortality</a></font></u> in the afterlife if they had done their best in life. This supported the belief that the dead could be contacted and offer a believer protection in their life on Earth.
&buddha1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12"><b>Buddhism</b><br>This is a statue of Buddha Amitabha, The Buddha of Western Paradise. Buddhism was introduced by Siddhartha Gautama, who had been born into an Indian royal family in the 6th century B.C.

The first record of Buddhism in China is in A.D. 65. Texts about Buddhist beliefs were introduced into China and translated in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. Buddhism was most popular in the Tang dynasty, despite Buddhist monks and nuns suffering <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/persecution.html','glos')">persecution</a></font></u> in A.D. 845.
&buddha2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12">In China believers followed traditional Buddhist ideals including <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/meditation.html','glos')">meditation;</a></font></u> rebirths eventually leading to <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/n/nirvana.html','glos')">Nirvana</a></font></u> and having to follow the sacred rules. To fit in with existing <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/confucian.html','glos')">Confucian</a></font></u> beliefs a change was made to the relationship between husbands and wives. Instead of respecting each other it became rephrased so a husband controls his wife and a wife respects her husband. Worship would take place in temples or places like the Cave of the Thousand Buddhas.
&buddha3=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12">Followers would make offerings and pray to a particular image for guidance or help. After death a believer is <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/reincarnated.html','glos')">reincarnated</a></font></u> until such time as they have earned the right to be in Nirvana.
&confucious1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12"><b>Confucianism</b><br>This rubbing shows Confucius, who lived during the 6th and early 5th centuries B.C. He travelled around different Chinese kingdoms teaching ideas on how people should behave in society. <br><br>After his death his beliefs became popular. In the Han dynasty they were written down by his followers in a book called <i>The Analects</i>. Believers learned how to respect authority, be moderate and have high levels of <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/morality.html','glos')">morality</a></font></u>. Respect of authority depended on the different types of relationships, e.g. emperor and subjects, husband and wife or father and son (known as <u><font color="#FFFF00"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/filial_piety.html','glos')">filial piety</a></font></u>). Filial piety was important because it was the base for morality. Morality came from education and following good examples in life. Moderation came from respecting authority and having high morals.
&confucious2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="12">Confucianism also included ancient beliefs in spirits, rivers and the natural elements. Temples and family altars were some places of worship. Descendants of the dead made offerings to their ancestors hoping that they would bring them good fortune and protection. In return this ensured that the dead had a fruitful afterlife.</font>
